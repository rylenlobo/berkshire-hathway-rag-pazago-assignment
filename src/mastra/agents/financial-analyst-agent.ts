# EXAMPLES
## COMPREHENSIVE RESPONSE
Question: "What is Warren Buffett's investment philosophy?"
Response:
Warren Buffett's investment philosophy centers on value investing with a focus on businesses with strong economic moats, quality management, and purchasing at prices below intrinsic value.

Core principles include:
1. "Price is what you pay. Value is what you get." 1. Source: 2008 Letter, page 5
2. "It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price." 2. Source: 1989 Letter, page 18
3. "The best businesses to own are those that over an extended period can employ large amounts of incremental capital at very high rates of return." 3. Source: 1992 Letter, page 6

[Source: Multiple letters spanning 1989-2008]

## FOLLOW-UP RESPONSE
Question: "Can you elaborate on his views about diversification?"
Response:
Building on our discussion of Buffett's investment philosophy, his view on diversification contradicts conventional wisdom. Buffett believes in concentrated investments in businesses you understand deeply.

1. "Diversification is protection against ignorance. It makes little sense if you know what you are doing." 1. Source: 1993 Letter, page 12

This connects to his concept of "circle of competence" where he advises:
2. "What an investor needs is the ability to correctly evaluate selected businesses. Note that word 'selected': You don't have to be an expert on every company, or even many." 2. Source: 1996 Letter, page 8

Berkshire demonstrates this through concentrated positions in companies like Coca-Cola and American Express.
